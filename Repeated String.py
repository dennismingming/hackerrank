# Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
# 
# Given an integer,n , find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.
# 
# For example, if the string s = 'abcac' and n = 10 , the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.
# 
# Function Description
# 
# Complete the repeatedString function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of occurrences of a in the prefix of length n in the infinitely repeating string.
# 
# repeatedString has the following parameter(s):
# 
# s: a string to repeat
# n: the number of characters to consider
# Input Format
# 
# The first line contains a single string,s .
# The second line contains an integer,n .
# 
# Constraints
# $ 1<= |S|<=100 $
# $ 1<= n <= 10^{12} $
# For 25% of the test cases,$n<=10^6 $.
# Output Format
# 
# Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first n letters of the infinite string created by repeating s infinitely many times.
# 
# Sample Input 0
# 
# aba
# 10
# Sample Output 0
# 
# 7
# Explanation 0
# The first $n=10$ letters of the infinite string are abaabaabaa. Because there are 7 a's, we print 7 on a new line.
# 
# Sample Input 1
# 
# a
# 1000000000000
# Sample Output 1
# 
# 1000000000000
# Explanation 1
# Because all of the first $n=1000000000000$ letters of the infinite string are a, we print 1000000000000 on a new line.
